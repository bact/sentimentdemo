# Sentiment Demo: A Simple AI Application and its AI BOM Example

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14055332.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14055332)

A simple text classification application, published solely to demonstrate
[a software bill of materials (SBOM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_supply_chain)
in [SPDX 3.0 format](https://spdx.dev/use/specifications/).

**The main content of the package is its software bill of materials at
[bom.spdx3.json](./bom.spdx3.json).**
Other files are given just to complete the illustration.

*Not recommended for actual text classification tasks.*

SBOM demonstration design goals:

- **Comprehensible:** Small enough for a human to understand easily.
- **Informative:** Elaborate enough to showcase the use of various information fields within an SBOM.
- **Testable:** Designed to facilitate testing and evaluation against specific use case requirements.

*Since May 2025, this AI SBOM example is accepted to the **SPDX Examples** repository,*
*as [ai/example02](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-examples/tree/master/ai/example02).*

Dataset Bill of Materials”](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/ai-bom), The Linux Foundation, October 2024*.

## Usage

See [instruction for use](./techdocs/instructions.md) for how to use the
application.

## Data preparation

See [data preparation](./techdocs/dataprepare.md).

## Notes

- Development is in the `main` branch.
- Will eventually be submitted to
  [spdx/spdx-examples](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-examples) repo.
- The diagram is generated from a PlantUML file:
  [bom.spdx.puml](./bom.spdx3.puml).
  The PlantUML file is generated by
  [spdx3ToGraph](https://github.com/maxhbr/spdx3ToGraph).
  To brevity, spdxIds and long strings are shortened by the
  [shortenid.sh](./tools/shortenid.sh) script in tools/, and all but one
  hyperparameter have been manually removed.
- The energy used by the computer during model training is tracked by
  [energy-tracker](https://github.com/rdegges/energy-tracker).
  It measures how much energy the computer uses during the training.
  This means the actual energy used for training the model might be a bit less
  than the reported amount.
- The SPDX 3.0.1 SBOM is validated structurally against the JSON Schema at
  <https://spdx.org/schema/3.0.1/spdx-json-schema.json>
  and semantically against the SHACL model at
  <https://spdx.org/rdf/3.0.1/spdx-model.ttl>.
- Next steps:
  - Add external dependency relationships
    (e.g. `dependsOn`, `hasProvidedDependency`)
  - Get tested with an SBOM quality check tool like
    [sbomsq](https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbomqs) (once it supports SPDX
    3.0).
  - Using information requirements and obligations in the EU AI Act as a
    target, labeling all relevant properties and relationships with
    corresponding difficulty levels and support levels, based on the
    [BOM Maturity Model](https://scvs.owasp.org/bom-maturity-model/difficulty-levels/).
